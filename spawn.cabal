description:
  Spawn a concurrent 'IO' computation and later demand its result.  Tiny API
  and implementation.
  .
  New in version 0.3.1:
  .
    * Added functions @concurrently@, @concurrently_@.
  .
  New in version 0.3:
  .
    * Added functions @parMapIO@, @parMapIO_@, and @(|*|)@, which capture
      common use cases of @spawn@.
  .
    * Updated code to avoid using deprecated functions with @base-4.3@ and
      later (GHC 7.0 and later).  The old code is still used with older
      @base@ libraries.
  .
    * Added public GitHub repository.
